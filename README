<h2>TabApp</h2>

<p>I realized a couple of weeks ago that I always end up going from Google to Ultimate-Guitar.com to find guitar tabs.</p> 

<p>The entire process was distracting and kept me from focusing on what I wanted to do, play my guitar.</p>

<p>So, in some of my free time, I've created a new application, TabApp, which allows <b>registered users of Ultimate-Guitar.com</b> to quickly access their saved tabs and search for new songs.</p>
